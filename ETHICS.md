# Ethics Statement for Veriduct

Veriduct was created to redefine the boundaries of civilian data protection in a world where conventional encryption is increasingly insufficient. This tool does not conceal data - it renders it cognitively inert without explicit reassembly intent. Its purpose is not to hide wrongdoing, but to restore **agency over interpretation** itself.

## Intended Use

Veriduct is designed to serve individuals and organizations operating under real or potential digital oppression, including but not limited to:

- Journalists working in surveillance-heavy regions
- Human rights activists needing untraceable data storage
- Citizens and whistleblowers resisting authoritarian information control
- Researchers exploring anti-forensic and post-encryption paradigms
- Security practitioners seeking nontraditional integrity models

## Core Principles

- **Privacy is a right, not a privilege.**
- **Interpretability is not a default.**
- **Reconstruction should only occur with willful and contextual alignment.**
- **The absence of ciphertext is not a crime - it is a paradigm shift.**

## Boundaries

Veriduct is not intended to:
- Obstruct legal oversight in criminal investigations
- Conceal harmful or exploitative activity
- Circumvent reasonable, consent-based data governance
- Replace ethical decision-making with technological force

It is not a tool for destruction - it is a tool for **detachment**. What you rebuild, and why, remains your responsibility.

## Developer Position

This framework was developed in the open, in good faith, and with a commitment to civilian empowerment. The creator of Veriduct does not condone illegal or unethical use and assumes no responsibility for misuse or unintended outcomes.

Use of this tool constitutes an agreement to uphold these principles.

Veriduct is not just about data - it is about meaning.  
And meaning belongs to the one who creates it, not the one who seizes it.
