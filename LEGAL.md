## Project: Veriduct  
**Author:** Independent Developer

## 1. Purpose

Veriduct is an open-source framework for **civilian data protection** through irreversible **semantic disassembly**. It dismantles the structural and contextual integrity of digital files, breaking them into unrecognizable, formatless fragments that cannot be interpreted or reconstructed without a separately stored reassembly key.

Veriduct is not a cipher. It performs **no encryption** in the traditional sense. Instead, it removes all semantic coherence, structural headers, and identifiable patterns from the source material, rendering it unclassifiable and forensically inert.

## 2. Legal Standing

This software:
- Was created **independently**, without institutional backing, classified access, or any corporate or government affiliation.
- Does **not include**, reuse, or derive from any **proprietary**, **confidential**, or **restricted** codebase.
- Was developed using **original code** and **open documentation**, with full authorship retained by the creator.

Veriduct is a civilian tool for personal privacy, journalistic protection, academic study, and legitimate nonviolent resistance to data surveillance and extraction.

## 3. Export & Compliance

Because Veriduct performs **no cryptographic transformation** and produces **no ciphertext**, it does not fall under traditional export controls for encryption software. Specifically:

- It is **not subject to ITAR** (International Traffic in Arms Regulations).
- It does not meet the definition of encryption under [EAR Category 5, Part 2](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-15/subtitle-B/chapter-VII/subchapter-C/part-742/section-742.15).
- It qualifies as a **public domain data handling method** that may be published, forked, studied, and shared freely within legal bounds.

Export to embargoed countries or restricted individuals remains prohibited under general U.S. export law.

## 4. Disclaimer of Use

Veriduct is a security methodology. It may be powerful, but it is also neutral. The author:
- **Disclaims all liability** for unlawful, unethical, or malicious use.
- **Does not condone** the concealment of illegal content.
- Encourages all users to operate within the bounds of applicable law and human rights frameworks.

Use Veriduct as it was intended: to protect thought, speech, privacy, and freedom in an increasingly hostile digital environment.
